You kick over one of the gang's barrels of oil. 
Black crude spills out, and you splash it around, 
leaving a trail back to the doorway. Pulling out your 
lighter, your trembling hands lower to the floor. 
#BREAK#
A trail of fire bursts across the catwalk, down the 
stairs, and into the puddle of oil. The containers 
burst into flames, the intense heat bringing back bad 
memories. Ammunition begins to cook off, causing pops. 
You leave the burning containers behind, to engulf the 
warehouse in flames. Lex Talionis.
